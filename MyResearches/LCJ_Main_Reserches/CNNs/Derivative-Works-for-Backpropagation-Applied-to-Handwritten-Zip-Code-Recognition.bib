abstract = {Nowadays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are being employed in a wide range of industrial technologies for a variety of sectors, such as medical, automotive, aviation, agriculture, space, etc. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in both the field of CNNs for image classification and object detection and Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) in a synergetic way. Layer-based details of CNNs along with parameter and floating-point operation number calculations are outlined. Using an evolutionary approach, the majority of the outstanding image classification CNNs, published in the open literature, is introduced with a focus on their accuracy performance, parameter number, model size, and inference speed, highlighting the progressive developments in convolutional operations. Results of a novel investigation of the convolution types and operations commonly used in CNNs are presented, including a timing analysis aimed at assessing their impact on CNN performance. This extensive experimental study provides new insight into the behaviour of each convolution type in terms of training time, inference time, and layer level decomposition. Building blocks for CNN-based object detection are also discussed, such as backbone networks and baseline types, and then representative state-of-the-art designs are outlined. Experimental results from the literature are summarised for each of the reviewed models. This is followed by an overview of recent ADSs related works and current industry activities, aiming to bridge academic research and industry practice on CNNs and ADSs. Design approaches targeted at solving problems of automakers in achieving real-time implementations are also proposed based on a discussion of design constraints, human vs. machine evaluations and trade-off analysis of accuracy vs. size. Current technologies, promising directions, and expectations from the literature on ADSs are introduced including a comprehensive trade-off analysis from a human-machine perspective.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has great influence on large parts of science and increasingly established itself as an adaptive method for new challenges in the field of Earth observation (EO). Nevertheless, the entry barriers for EO researchers are high due to the dense and rapidly developing field mainly driven by advances in computer vision (CV). To lower the barriers for researchers in EO, this review gives an overview of the evolution of DL with a focus on image segmentation and object detection in convolutional neural networks (CNN). The survey starts in 2012, when a CNN set new standards in image recognition, and lasts until late 2019. Thereby, we highlight the connections between the most important CNN architectures and cornerstones coming from CV in order to alleviate the evaluation of modern DL models. Furthermore, we briefly outline the evolution of the most popular DL frameworks and provide a summary of datasets in EO. By discussing well performing DL architectures on these datasets as well as reflecting on advances made in CV and their impact on future research in EO, we narrow the gap between the reviewed, theoretical concepts from CV and practical application in EO.},

abstract = {Object detection, as of one the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. Over the past two decades, we have seen a rapid technological evolution of object detection and its profound impact on the entire computer vision field. If we consider today’s object detection technique as a revolution driven by deep learning, then, back in the 1990s, we would see the ingenious thinking and long-term perspective design of early computer vision. This article extensively reviews this fast-moving research field in the light of technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century’s time (from the 1990s to 2022). A number of topics have been covered in this article, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speedup techniques, and recent state-of-the-art detection methods.},

abstract = {Robot vision is an essential research field that enables machines to perform various tasks by classifying/detecting/segmenting objects as humans do. The classification accuracy of machine learning algorithms already exceeds that of a well-trained human, and the results are rather saturated. Hence, in recent years, many studies have been conducted in the direction of reducing the weight of the model and applying it to mobile devices. For this purpose, we propose a multipath lightweight deep network using randomly selected dilated convolutions. The proposed network consists of two sets of multipath networks (minimum 2, maximum 8), where the output feature maps of one path are concatenated with the input feature maps of the other path so that the features are reusable and abundant. We also replace the 3×3 standard convolution of each path with a randomly selected dilated convolution, which has the effect of increasing the receptive field. The proposed network lowers the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) and parameters by more than 50% and the classification error by 0.8% as compared to the state-of-the-art. We show that the proposed network is efficient.},
