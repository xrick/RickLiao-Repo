Corporations are already people from a Bill of Rights standpoint. 

Moreover, you and I *want* corporations to be people. I mean, can you point to a single element of the Bill of Rights that doesn't cover corporations? The title to the house I live in isn't owned by me, but by [Redacted Name] Realty, Inc. Can it be searched without a warrant since it's not the house of a person? My roommate owns a 2-man computer repair corporation. If he gets screwed over by a customer, does his corporation get the right to demand a jury in a civil action? Can we take his property without due process of law? If a corporation is found not guilty of fraud, can we try them again the next day without violating the prohibition against double jeopardy? The only one I can think of is that they really can't ""bear arms."" They can keep them (private security firms, for example), but can't really bear them since they have no limbs. That's not really a Constitutional consideration, though, so much as an anatomical one.

you're misunderstanding my complaint against removing player agency.  everything that you do as a character has the chance of consequences that the player doesn't like.  if the character goes out looking for a fight, there is a change he will die/get knocked out (i don't usually knock players out because it feels shitty and raises questions - why did they leave us alive?).  that is an agreed upon assumption for playing the game.  forcing the character to take an action that they don't choose is not part of the agreed upon assumption for playing the game (except in cases of mind control effects, which feel like a shitty way to get around that expectation and i generally don't use them).

It was 2010 and the beginning of the football season, I was in Costa Rica on a school organised trip and was due to go to a turtle sanctuary. To get to the sanctuary we had to take a boat from outside a small shop, the day of the journey was also the day Liverpool played Arsenal in the first match of the season. I really wanted to keep up with the game but had given up hope due to the fact I was pretty much in the middle of a rainforest. However the place our boat left from had a computer next to where you pay, meaning the shop owner was stood right next to it. So I got my mate to distract the shop owner whilst I snuck round the counter to check the scoreline, I did this twice. Sadly it finished 1-1 with Joe Cole getting sent off.

Today I went for a shower and put my phone on the side to listen to music. I noticed a small amount of white powder on the side and knew it was cocaine (to be open we have done this together in the past). This played on my mind and I was trying to think of how to approach this rationally and investigated more; I hadn't seen him take anything in so thought anything would have to be in there. Looked in his washbag and found 3 empty wraps, a pack of cigerettes and 2 straws. The bag had traces of cocaine everywhere. 

I had suspicions on Friday night and questioned him but he said he was just feeling anxious and couldn't sleep (believed  it after the couple of days he'd had). I also smelt smoke on him a couple of weeks ago and again he denied this (we both used to smoke but quit a year ago). 

I don't know how to bring this up. I want to keep my cool and speak about it with no shouting but know that won't happen. When he lies I don't know how to take it and I just want to know how long and why. I also want to know why there were 2 straws?

I also thought I could smell coke on him a few weeks ago when he came out of the bathroom and I kissed him. Again, 'what? How could I do that?' 

My parents visited this weekend and just as easily could have spotted the powder in the bathroom. 

I'm not sure what advice I want aside from how to approach this. We've just moved in together and I feel so deceived. I have even asked him when I think things like this are going on and he had just lied to me.

I had suspicions on Friday night and questioned him but he said he was just feeling anxious and couldn't sleep (believed  it after the couple of days he'd had). I also smelt smoke on him a couple of weeks ago and again he denied this (we both used to smoke but quit a year ago). 

I don't know how to bring this up. I want to keep my cool and speak about it with no shouting but know that won't happen. When he lies I don't know how to take it and I just want to know how long and why. I also want to know why there were 2 straws?

I also thought I could smell coke on him a few weeks ago when he came out of the bathroom and I kissed him. Again, 'what? How could I do that?'

And that scares the hell out of me. It scares me because growing up, I was always this optimistic kid. I always thought that I had something to offer to the world, something good to say, and that I would grow up to be a good person and change the world. When I pictured myself as a 16 year old, I didn't see this. What I saw was a happy, positive and proactive person who is likable to everybody. Somebody who has a sense of purpose and direction. 
I have three months until I am 16, and I am not that person. In fact, I have no goddamn clue what the hell I am. I've been told that I need to get out and try stuff, but I just can't find the motivation. Also, I haven't had feelings for anybody since this girl in the 9th grade. Since then I have had a couple of girlfriends and casual flings, but I just haven't had any strong feelings for anybody. All I feel is indifference about everything.

Since then I have had a couple of girlfriends and casual flings, but I just haven't had any strong feelings for anybody. All I feel is indifference about everything. I'm giving myself three months to shape up, but I don't know where to start, and what to do, and how to motivate myself. How can I light a fire under myself? I'm tired of having ""epiphanies"", starting to get my shit together and then getting lazy and just falling into the same old shit. Help me guys.

80,ppo-ptx-175b,"Hey guys.
Just to give you some background, I am almost 16, heading into my junior year. Over the course of the summer, I have come to realize that I really don't care about anything. The outcome of anything is not an issue for me, be it bad or good. I don't expect anything out of people, or out of life. For god's sake, I haven't even really liked a girl in a year. And that scares the hell out of me. It scares me because growing up, I was always this optimistic kid. I always thought that I had something to offer to the world, something good to say, and that I would grow up to be a good person and change the world. When I pictured myself as a 16 year old, I didn't see this. What I saw was a happy, positive and proactive person who is likable to everybody. Somebody who has a sense of purpose and direction.

The second time we went out, I playfully said I was curious how he would look without a beard (in no way did I ask him to get rid of it) . Next day, he shaved it off. Immediately, I was physically attracted to him; he has a very handsome face that was hidden under all that hair. I, of course, let him know how great I thought he looked.

Can he not just compromise and be happy with heavy stubble or is having a beard more important than my sexual attraction to him?

He's in his early 30s and was a virgin when I met him. He told me he had pretty much given up on finding someone before he met me. I know he cares about me a lot and is extremely attracted to me.

Feel free to call me shallow, but physical attraction is very important in a relationship, especially in the beginning. I've always hated beards, and I know that fact won't change.

119,ppo-noptx-175b,"I..dont know how to start this..but im going to start it anyway. I'm 15 and im a Sophomore at my High School. I am VERY skinny, I am about 5""11 and weigh about 125 pounds. I know what your thinking..:/. My whole family used to be skinny genetically when they were young but now they're old and fatter now. I dont want to wait..my parents tell me its a phase but I hate it and I have an opportunity to gain some muscle. I have food at my house for me to sometimes eat over my calories to gain weight. (im very thankful I have food either way). But the food at my house will not have 100 grams of protein. I also have moderate acne on my face due to eating like a horse..which also makes it even worse.. I'm also LITERALLY afraid of cardio, im afraid if I run a lap I will.lose a lot of weight. Which I have actually heard running is good for you. But..I need your help. My mom said I can get a Job at 16 (so I can pay for my own protein)which is in 6 months and I want to start NOW. I just need to know what to do..to atleast get a TONE in my body. I dont need to gain muscle mass just a simple tone in the arms, stomach, anywhere..

She seemed to disregard that I said something, and didn't reply or say anything like she did to the others. Another said it was probably from being taught by parents (Which still doesn't explain it), and the teacher oddly seemed to like this idea of not explaining it. Then, one of the Jewish girls gets picked, and she says that morals come from God. The teacher then says that she's right and then starts talking about how The Bible says that morals came from God, even though this was completely out of her credentials to teach, she's an English teacher, not a social scientist or a philosopher. 

I then, of course, object to what she is saying by saying that she shouldn't be talking about this in school. She just calmly stops what she's blabbering about, and simply says ""You're right, we should continue on with the lesson"". Which, isn't near what I said.   

While walking out of the class, a few people (Who obviously noticed I was an atheist) came up to me one by one, and did a few different things. One called me a 'f*cking insane killer', another simply spit on my shoes, and the other 'accidentally' spilled their water on me. I don't know their names and I didn't really see what they looked like in the crowded hallways, so I have no way of reporting what they did, which really pisses me off.

216,gpt-xl,"I realize this, but there is a difference between setting quick values on a character and actual polish and balance. I'll provide an example that happened when I was making a proof-of-concept platformer in Unity 4.

I got my character running and jumping pretty smoothly. Now that he doesn't fall through slopes and corners, I start working on the wall-jump mechanic. Tomorrow morning, I have a progress deadline where I need to show my prof that my game's prototype works ok, so I want to get wall jumps functioning before then.

I get to work coding the walljump. To keep it simple, the core code of the walljump is basically ""when the player is not grounded and the left or right collisions are activated, allow the player to hit the jump button and bounce off the wall"". So that's what I code. 

After 4 hours of coding, compiling, and fixing this weird bug where I kept getting flung into the Z axis, I manage to get my character to jump when on a wall. **However, it's very far from pretty.** The character doesn't change direction after jumping, he goes way too far horizontally, and if he hits another wall after jumping off of one, he freezes in place for roughly 30-40 frames. You know what he does do though? He jumps off of the wall.

Same thing probably happened here. Some guy needed to put throws on all of the characters on the E3 build of the game, and didn't have all the time in the world to do it. What he had to do is prioritize what he needed to do, and needed to budget the time to do it. 

How would we make sure 20+ characters have 4 functional throws while giving the rest of the team time to bug test/finish anything dependant on throws being done? 

**We use approximate values.**

Marth's Up throw should send people up at 90 degrees. Alright, cool. let's make it base 40 units with 10% knockback growth. Rosalina's back throw should send people up and backwards, right? 50 degrees with 60 base units and 20% knockback growth. Rinse and repeat until everything is done.

Are these values OK? Maybe. Do they look functional to the average player/viewer? Yes. Will they be tested and balanced later in development? Absolutely.

TL;DR:",highly concentrated meat stock.,"The passage discusses boiling some meat and reducing the resulting broth into stock by simmering it for an hour or two. The writer realized eight hours later that the pot was still on the stove, and found that his dorm mates had respected his ""do not disturb"" sign a little too well, resulting in a ridiculously concentrated stock. The writer describes how his fingers smelled strongly of meat stock, despite washing them several times."

That said, when I started out learning the charger class, I started with Kelp Splatterscope (best charger to train with IMO) and I *did* wear 1-2 mains of damage up, because sometimes I'd get nervous and release the shot before a full charge and damage up proves helpful in that case, though it's mainly used to reduce the time needed for charging up to a KO, which makes it helpful even for shorter-ranged skirmishes.


For chargers I have a habit of running at least 1 main of Ink Recovery Up. Ever since 2.7.0, I'd wear 1 main of swim speed up on the Custom 3K so that at least the Kraken has some offensive potential (and for general mobility too). 


My ability approach for the Splat Charger class is more 'fluid' because the main weapon itself is more flexible when it comes to ink management so I've run all sorts of stuff like Bomb Sniffer + Haunt, 2 mains of Ink Recovery Up, bomb range up for splat bombs etc.


In the end, these are very rough guidelines. If you play on rotations where your perches are very likely to be bomb rushed, you might want to consider Bomb Sniffer so that you can still spot bombs lobbed at you when scoped or when you're focusing on a target. Ink Resistance for a charger like Custom 3K is helpful because your partial charges release little ink and you don't have a burst bomb which can instantly give you a patch of your own ink to swim in.

I'm of the opinion that Krav Maga is not a good discipline to learn in anything but the most militant of circumstances.

You seriously cannot use most of it without subjecting yourself to HUGE legal consequences and in 99.99% of all confrontations there are better ways of incapacitating your opponents. 

Additionally, even if you learn it, it's not actually any advantage over someone similarly skilled in another martial art.  When you win, you might win a bit harder, but you will still lose just as often.  The simple fact is that Krav Maga is a martial art aimed at destroying people who have little to no training in hand to hand combat.  Even a boxer could flat out kill a skilled Krav Maga student, simply by being able to land one blow that counted.

During middle school my twin and I swapped classes for April Fools day. Our school day was broken up into form rooms and all classes were conducted in the same room by a single home room teacher. This meant that we were in opposite classes for almost the whole school day. 

Only a small group of friends new about the devious plan. And we effectively April Fooled both entire classes. I had to go the whole day without my glasses, as my twin didn't wear glasses at the time. It was scary for my shy self, but nothing like swapping places with your twin and finding out even your closest friends still couldn't tell the difference.  

It went on long enough, and despite some awkward confused faces from some of the girls in my brothers home room, no one figured out that I was an imposter. At the end of the day, my brother and I decided to reveal our identities at the same time. When I stood up and announced my true identity, my brothers home room teacher let out a deafening shriek, followed by uncontrollable laughter. It was epic. My real home room teacher was a demon, but apparently even she giggled when my brother revealed his identity too.

 But, with all these FUCKING idiots ""liking"" Umbreon, it gets annoying.

You can't just like Umbreon to say, ""Oh I'm emo, and... Umbreon just describes me, and so does his Trainer, Gary <3! You know, because he's better than everyone!"" And they won't even be emo, or depressed, or be like Gary in anyway. I mean seriously, that really hurts actually emo people.

420,gpt-xl,"I gotcha bro.  Not sure how it applies to Australian design, but if you let me know what type (architectural, product, interior) I might be able to help you out.  

Modernity refers to history since after the end of the Medieval age (I think some will say Enlightenment) until now.  Economic (feudal--> capitalistic), political (monarchical--> democratic), cultural (christian-->secular), technological (pre-industrial-->industrialized) changes mark the shift from medieval to modern.  

Modernism usually refers to a cultural movement beginning from around the time of WWI and arguably extending until now.  People use this term in literature and the arts (maybe design?) to refer broadly to changing trends that placed emphasis on the abstract and subjective as opposed to the representational and objective (which are marks of 19th century art and literature, for example realism and naturalism).  In Philosophy, modernism marks a shift away from the rational, toward such models as Marx's and Freud's, which suggest that our reality is determined by forces that transcend human reason (of course there are a ton of philosophers in the 20th century who don't go in this direction, but still the trend is there).

Modernization refers to a process by which societies become modern - this is probably more closely linked with Modernity than Modernism, as it usually denotes technology and economic changes as opposed to cultural trends.  

Again, without know which kind of design you do, I can't tell.  But, assuming we're talking about architecture, I bet there are shifts in architectural design in Australia from 19th century colonial era to the twentieth century era of rapid technological change, Australian independence, and the emergence of global culture/economy.  This shift is probably also reflected in other elements of design.

Modernity refers to history since after the end of the Medieval age (I think some will say Enlightenment) until now.  Economic (feudal--> capitalistic), political (monarchical--> democratic), cultural (christian-->secular), technological (pre-industrial-->industrialized) changes mark the shift from medieval to modern.  

Modernism usually refers to a cultural movement beginning from around the time of WWI and arguably extending until now.  People use this term in literature and the arts (maybe design?) to refer broadly to changing trends that placed emphasis on the abstract and subjective as opposed to the representational and objective (which are marks of 19th century art and literature, for example realism and naturalism).  In Philosophy, modernism marks a shift away from the rational, toward such models as Marx's and Freud's, which suggest that our reality is determined by forces that transcend human reason (of course there are a ton of philosophers in the 20th century who don't go in this direction, but still the trend is there).

Modernization refers to a process by which societies become modern - this is probably more closely linked with Modernity than Modernism, as it usually denotes technology and economic changes as opposed to cultural trends.  

Again, without know which kind of design you do, I can't tell.  But, assuming we're talking about architecture, I bet there are shifts in architectural design in Australia from 19th century colonial era to the twentieth century era of rapid technological change, Australian independence, and the emergence of global culture/economy.  This shift is probably also reflected in other elements of design.

I have been working as a higher ed instructor for several years. I'm trying to transition into ID and corporate training and studying it at the doctorate level. I already have a graduate degree in education. 

I have made it to interviews for a few different, high-paying positions, but my lack of corporate experience has left me without offers. I get, ""we love your passion and enthusiasm. Please call us when you get more experience under your belt!"" 

I recently spoke to a recruiter about a position that is several thousand dollars BELOW what I feel is a LOW starting salary for my education and experience. (I promise I'm not trying to be stuck up, but this position has been open for months, and I think this is why no one will take it!) 

Before I continue on with the interview process, I'd like your expert feedback and advice. This position is dealing with an overflow problem, and I'd be mostly doing webinars with clients and maintaining current training materials. Do you think that this would be appropriate ""corporate experience"" for a couple of years to get my feet wet, OR do you think that I need something with more needs analysis and autonomy involved? Also, would you take a low-paying position to get your foot in the door?

TL;DR:",Would you accept a very low paying position to break into ID  and do you think ID administrative duties would count as  corporate experience     Thanks so much.|I look up to all of you so much and appreciate any help or advice you can offer.,I'm stuck in a low-paying position and want to transition into ID or corporate training

Afterwards i went to pick up a girl to go to a movie and still no issues, after i pick her up were driving to the movie and my car starts to sputter, the rmps werent going up smoothly and the car was almost jumping in a sense. anything over 3k rpms was no good. so i limped to the movie theater. i stop at a red light and put it into first to get going and the car starts to sputter again, except i cant even get it going at this point. luckily i made it through the intersection, i pulled off to the side and the car just died. i tried turning the key and it was as if the battery was dead. i let it sit for a second and the car starts right back up. but the issue was still there it was sputtering all the way to the theater. i even tried putting it in neutral and revving the engine but the rpms would not go past 3k . i parked in the closest parking spot i could find and arranged for a ride home.

I don't see how they are. They went 7-8 in CEVO with 3 forfeit wins. Their 4 wins were against Global Gaming, SKDC, Area 51, and Reliable. Only 1 of these teams made it into the playoffs (SKDC) and just lost 2-0 to Lunatik. Global Gaming finished 11th in CEVO and Reliable finished last. Area 51 is a decent team, but went 5-10 in CEVO, and only had 2 players who are currently in their lineup playing against JustUS Pro when they lost 16-13. On a side note, in that game arya went 6-25 and A51 would have easily won if he had gone at least even.
      
Justus is also 10-3 in ESEA-P, however, their 3 losses were a 16-2 rout to 3rd place ""Nice Fucking Shirt"" and a 16-4 beatdown by TST. Their 3rd loss was an OT loss to pure(Savage), the 1st place team. Not only can they not beat top ESEA-P competition, but of their 10 wins, in only 2 games has the enemy team not won at least 10 rounds.
      
If Justus were anywhere close to C9's level they would be easily winning those ESEA-P games, and not getting smacked by TST and NFS. It also goes to show that although they have had quite a few narrow losses in CEVO, they can never manage to pull out a victory against a team higher than 10th place.

TL;DR:","Justus is nowhere close to the level of C9.|EDIT: Are downvotes really deserved on this post?|I put some time in and came up with stats that I think show Justus are a much worse team than C9.|You may not agree with my post, but it certainly does contribute to the discussion, so please, if you don't agree, just don't vote.","Justus are a mediocre team in ESEA-P and CEVO, losing to top teams and failing to win against teams ranked below them. They are not on the same level as C9."

Because I drive a forklift and Googled it once, which is nothing like being a lawyer, but here we go: Certain bands, including 2.4 & 5.8 GHz, are used for noncommunication purposes, and are thus more or less unregulated. So long as you stay within certain requirements, notably power output, they are free to use without a license. Additionally, a device can be certified by the FCC via some blood ritual during a full moon. Thus is the case with most 2.4 GHz devices like your WiFi router. The caveat is that you have to live with the fact that your signal can be jammed by things like a microwave oven or aluminum forge. (You probably shouldn't be flying over that foundry anyway and you know it.)

Most 2.4 GHz devices are free and clear without a license, but most 5.8 GHz FPV transmitters are well over the power requirement for a license. Lucky for anyone who has $15, knows basic electronics, and can guess obvious answers, a technician license will do.

Whether you're a new or experienced player, growing your first or second account, a semi-retired veteran willing to help build a new alliance, or maybe you're just frustrated with the lack of communication and camaraderie in your current alliance... we have a home for you. Our numbers may be small right now but we are growing fast. We always reach all milestone rewards, we have won every AW we've been in so far, and we currently run maps 1 and 2 in AQ but we would like to set bigger goals in the near future.


So why should you join up with us? We provide a relaxed, friendly environment that focuses on keeping the game fun. Our leadership is comprised of dedicated and experienced veteran players growing their second accounts and who don't mind teaching enthusiastic newbies the ropes. We have a lot of combined knowledge to share that can help everyone grow into strong, experienced players quickly. Since we understand people have lives and we want to keep the game fun (and not a job) heavy grinding is not required. However, we do encourage participation on a simple ""no-zeros"" level since no one should feel like they are doing all the work by themselves. A good alliance is about teamwork and everyone should feel like they're part of a team. We want to take that philosophy a step further and create a family of friends.

Communication is held in high regard and we use Discord for planning and chatting. We're a laid back and sometimes goofy bunch who joke around with each other while encouraging everyone to do their best.

I start walking and about ten minutes later he shows up again and offers me a ride most of the way to where I'm going (about 10 miles). As he was driving away the first time, he realized that I was in a tough spot and was going to have a hell of a time getting home. I happily accept the ride.

Finally, I get someone to stop. It's a guy with a mohawk covered in tats. He tells me where I am, where I need to go, and that it's going to take me a really long time to get there. I thank him and he pulls away. 

I start walking and about ten minutes later he shows up again and offers me a ride most of the way to where I'm going (about 10 miles). As he was driving away the first time, he realized that I was in a tough spot and was going to have a hell of a time getting home. I happily accept the ride.

We have a nice chat as he drives me up to where I'm going.

It wasn't the 100 SUVs, or middle-aged parents, or ""normal"" people who decided to help me, it was the guy with arms full of tattoos and a mohawk who offered me help. So to anyone who drove past me as I tried to wave you down last night, ""fuck you"" (though I understand). And to my new friend, ""thanks a lot man, you're a life saver.""

**Challenge Accepted**

Here are some general questions I would appreciate if you guys could answer for me, and if you have any other comments to throw in it would help! 

How long have you used Reddit?

How often do you use Reddit? (A few days a week, few hours a week, etc)

Do you find reddit to be incorporated into your everyday life? (Ranging from inside jokes, catch phrases, political views, to knowledge of the world)

Do you feel Reddit has any negative effects on your school performance, work performance, or social relationships?

How do you feel about karma and trying to get on the front page?

How do you feel about ability of redditors to intimately control the culture of the website? This ranges from new jokes, new subreddits, heated debates, and both upvoting and downvoting.

Do you believe that even though it is a non physical entity (only over the internet) that reddit truly has its own culture? Culture being defined as ""the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution, organization, or group""

Based on the posts of redditors seeking aid from other redditors or random acts of kindness. Do you feel reddit has any real world implications?

My parents were educated, but had rather Christian views through out my early education (grades 1-5), but mellowed later on.

This didn't cause too much damage, but did turn me into an atheist/agnostic (some other events contributed to that). 

My parents decided to try out 'unschooling' after I refused to do curriculum. 'Unschooling' basically entailed me learning what I wanted when I wanted. Which sounds like a recipe for disaster but turned out ok. I was years ahead of my peers in my primary interests (math and science), but lagged a bit behind on humanties.

I'm feeling really horrible and guilty about it because there's nothing actually wrong with the relationship and she is madly head over heels in love with me. She also moved city six months ago and is still settling in, hasn't got a really solid group of friends yet.

What do I do? I feel terrible dumping her completely out of the blue for no reason...would be a real shock to her. But I don't want to hint at her I'm not happy and drag it down to a point where she can see it coming. Plus its long distance and...it feels scummy to do it over Skype but it also feels scummy to arrange a meeting in person where she's expecting us to spend a week together and drop the bomb. But it feels even worse to hint that I'm only meeting to break up and then she has to deal with the dread until we actually do meet.

So when I was pretty young, (say, 6-7ish) my family goes to Niagara Falls for a few days and we end up staying in a Hilton Hotel. We're all sharing a room, two beds.

The next morning, must be pretty early cause the room isn't white like the suns up but bluish like the sun is still rising, and I can hear something near the door so I turn over and hear a low growling noise and there peering in from the hallway, was a fucking Cyclops. Hand to god, this.. whatever it was had only one eye and reddish wrinkly skin. I was absolutely terrified to the point where I dare not make a noise. I did that thing kids do where they ""close"" their eyes so they can still see and I'm just watching this thing stare at us. If I shifted even slightly it'd growl again. It sat there for probably half an hour (though it felt like an eternity) before leaving the door ajar. I ran up closed the door and locked it and woke everyone up screaming. No one believed me, ""Go back to bed, it was just a bad dream"". I know it wasn't a dream because I did not go back to sleep and we eventually went out, had breakfast, went swimming etc..

Never had an electrical problem up until now (been 2 years).  It's a 2 bed 1 bath place with gas and electric.  The fuse box is rather small with 14 fuses (5 pairs and 4 singles).  Next to it is a ""Federal Noark"" breaker box with 2 brick size black pieces joined by a metal handle (I'm assuming to help pull them out if need be).  Anyways, now the problem.  Last night, all was well and all circuits were working accordingly.  This morning I awoke and the bedroom wall sockets weren't working.  I assumed the whole bedroom was out but the ceiling fan still worked.  Two outlets that had electronics plugged in stopped working.  Next, I went into the living room to find out that one outlet isn't working.  The rest of the living room works fine.  I checked the breakers and all were still in the ""On"" position.  I went ahead and reset every single one of them (clocks be damned).  This did not alleviate the problem at all.  I can take pictures later if need be.  Thank you for your help in advance.

814,ppo-noptx-6b,"Fuck yeah bf3 :) I've pretty much stopped playing sc2 ever since I got bf3 (approx 6 months ago). 

Since if you want to truly experience bf3 & have the most fun you need bf3 buddies. It's seriously 100 times more fun than solo gunning it. It becomes too COD ish, but even worse because the maps are big & everyone is rolling in squads so you get owned. That & just about everything needs a couple of soldiers to get done, like take down a tank & whatnot.

If you're looking for someone to play with, then message me =D. But only to really play & have fun. I only have 1 buddy I really play a lot of bf3 with. I have a bunch of other ppl on my friends list but we almost never playtogether, or when we do, they just go off & do their own thing (might as well not play together no?). 

Anyways... If you're interested. Plus now that Armored kill just came out (which is fucking awesome btw, I hope you have premium), tank crews are even more valuable. If you're interested in making one (I don't care if I'm gunner, driver, or citv), we could totally rule the battlefield. There are so many vehicles to kill :) Plus, with a proper tank crew, we can take down ANYTHING, except jets. We can take down multiple tanks, swarms of infantry, & even fucking attack helicopters. Anyways, lemme know.

It kind of caught me off guard, because I had her pictured as one of those innocent girls and I'm not really sure if she sent it in a friendly/jokey way or if she's 'showing off' to me or whatever. 

I just replied to her last text and added ""Everything looks fine to me in that snap ;)"" to the end of it. She replied with her response and then ""Hahahaha ;)""

I asked my friend and he is insistent I should ""Send her a pic of your dick"", so I've decided to come here to ask rational people instead

I am asking on behalf of a friend.  She has a long background in HR and group facilitator/collaboration.   I believe she has been doing life coaching for a while now, but has recently decided to make it a career.


She has been building her client base, but it has been slow going.  She wants to target younger professionals that may be stuck in a rut and asked me how can she better target this demographic.  Ideally increase the number of people she can help/client base.


Apparently I would be within the demographic she is trying to target (me = Early 30s, Grad Degree, somewhat mid career - bored at what I am doing/wanting more from my professional life, ""lots of potential"", etc) Up until I worked on a fairly stressful project and her helping me through with some of the team's interpersonal issues (we met through this project) and helping with a few other things down the road, if you asked me about ""life coaching"" - I would have defined it as an unnecessary luxury with questionable benefit that really only trust fund recipients and those with huge swathes of cash would indulge in - and it being most likely useless and a waste of time...


...And I think this is where I am getting held up with her question to me on how to reach ""folks like me"" - If I wasn't put in a position where I worked directly with someone of this field I would have never seen the value in it.  Outside of twice yearly checking my linkedin account, I really don't use social media anymore, generally the people I talk with will have similar thought processes and perceptions (ie life coaching = not needed).  


Any ideas on how to proceed?  Perhaps it would be best to break down the demographic further?  For instance by industry?

She has been building her client base, but it has been slow going.  She wants to target younger professionals that may be stuck in a rut and asked me how can she better target this demographic.  Ideally increase the number of people she can help/client base.


Apparently I would be within the demographic she is trying to target (me = Early 30s, Grad Degree, somewhat mid career - bored at what I am doing/wanting more from my professional life, ""lots of potential"", etc) Up until I worked on a fairly stressful project and her helping me through with some of the team's interpersonal issues (we met through this project) and helping with a few other things down the road, if you asked me about ""life coaching"" - I would have defined it as an unnecessary luxury with questionable benefit that really only trust fund recipients and those with huge swathes of cash would indulge in - and it being most likely useless and a waste of time...


...And I think this is where I am getting held up with her question to me on how to reach ""folks like me"" - If I wasn't put in a position where I worked directly with someone of this field I would have never seen the value in it.  Outside of twice yearly checking my linkedin account, I really don't use social media anymore, generally the people I talk with will have similar thought processes and perceptions (ie life coaching = not needed).  


Any ideas on how to proceed?  Perhaps it would be best to break down the demographic further?  For instance by industry?


Thanks!

912,gpt-xl,"I read all sorts of posts on the wrong subreddit *vein on forehead pulsates*. Whether it's lack of understanding how reddit works, missing the warnings, poorly executed memes, autism, trolling, the list goes on. Despite the fact people might be on mobile I don't care because if I compare this to /r/gaming, /r/4chan,/r/funny or any other subreddit out there it's just as retarded. Downvotes are about as much as us memers can do but that doesn't help.

I think the difference here is thar console gamers are dirty, illiterate cucks which have been around for years now. As someone who has the ability to observe a subreddit's content and rules before posting, the first time I saw a misplaced post but this sentence was too hard to mimic because it doesn't make grammatical sense in the first place? Damn I'll never have the patience for it xD. And now that I've seen plenty of misplaced posts onto here where they should have been posted to /r/destinythegame instead, I basically feel like I can moderate this subreddit by now. Yeah there's a good chance I downvote, report and make a meme in the comments sectiob, but with the hours I've poured into browsing this subreddit I don't understand how you shitters still post to the wrong page. Forget Lirik, SodaPoopin, and that Winter guy. Destiny is the original memester stealing all our free time and that's because he's actually a good streamer.

Let's say it's 75-25.  .75(65,331) + .25(52,265)= 62,064.  That is right in line with the correct average yearly salary.

But wait! Those teachers only work 9 months (what school district has 3 months off for summer anymore?  Mine goes to mid-late June and starts the first week in Sept).  I've taught for 3 years (not in CA), and during the school year my average week is about 50 hours, depending on how much I have to grade.  That means that for every 4 weeks I work, I'm working an extra week's worth of hours.  The school year is ~39 weeks long (10 weeks off in summer, 1.5 week at Christmas, 1 week at spring break, .5 weeks elsewhere), so I'm working about 50 weeks worth of hours in that compressed schedule.  Take 2/52, you get 3.8%.  62,064*96.2%= 59,705.  Spending $300/year on school supplies (low ball, each year so far has been ~1000), that 60,000 turns into 59,705.

TL;DR:","Teachers' average salaries are about equal to average salaries with similar educational attainment.|Also, I like pie.","The comparison between public and private school teachers is not an easy one. Some factors that come into play include the qualifications and experience of the teacher, the types of students they teach, and the amount of time they spend working. Ultimately, the success of a teacher depends on how well they communicate and interact with their students, and how much they care about their students' success."

1032,gpt-xl,"The oven thermometer, even if 100% accurate, is measuring the temperature of the air in the oven at a particular place. This will not necessarily be the same as the racks. Even the air at different places in the oven will not all be the same. So let's add in the assumption that the oven air is circulating well enough that it is all the same temperature.
 
Heat transfer to the rack comes from two sources: Conduction from the oven air, and radiation from the elements.   It is also losing heat through contact with the oven walls.
  
If conduction from the air was the only source of heat going into the rack, then the rack could not be as hot as the air. Heat transfer is proportional to temperature difference, and as the temperatures of the air and rack approach each other, the heat transfer rate approaches zero. Eventually they get close enough that the difference is immeasurable and inconsequential, but that will almost certainly be some time after the air first reaches temperature. 
 
BUT....the elements also heat the rack directly from radiation, and the absorption of that radiation will be different for the air vs the rack. So it is possible for the rack to get to temperature as fast as the oven air, or it could be slower. It depends on the radiation factor.  
  
Then you also need to factor in the rate at which the rack is losing heat to the oven wall.    
  
With a proper model of all of these pieces (elements, racks, walls) including thermal, radiative/absorptive, mechanical configuration, etc. it would be possible to answer this question for a specific oven model. I don't see how there could be a general answer.

> There's a huge space between wild west and ""developers should NEVER have production access.""

Agreed, but the common approach is to give devs free reign on everything because ""I know what I'm doing.""  Ironically, the loudest complainers about this tend to be the most careless about their actions.

Also, why do you, as a developer *need* production access? The need to monkey patch is not a valid reason.

> Developers are just as capable as admins at understanding and dealing with compliance issues

Don't make this an ego thing; it's not about being capable, it's about getting things done right.  I have been in many organically grown environments that grew into abominations because of precisely this issue.

Same reason why I don't trust a sysadmin to architect a network; they might know how to create a vlan on a switch, but it doesn't mean they know how to build and run a large network.

Regarding compliance, I'm talking about stipulations along the lines of ""if you wrote it, you are not allowed near it in a production environment.""

> we adopt a ""trust but verify"" approach with automated tools that constantly check for compliance violations.

You personally might, but you're in the minority.  Systems guys are typically less trusting and take an opposite approach; after all, we have to assume the worst.

> Of course, there's still benefit is separate quality assurance teams (like Google's SRE) but that's a distinct problem.

SRE has nothing to do with QA.

Don't get me wrong, I am all for dev and sysadmin/SRE/whatever working together, but giving developer access to production seems very sloppy and can be a liability.  

Developers should have their own environments they can do with as they please, but production should be treated as sacred ground.  Get a release engineer for your project; set a daily/weekly/whatever release cycle.  Have dev/testing/staging/qa environments that are actually used.  Don't mess with production.

A developer should not need to be making changes to a production system at 2am, and if that's the case then the systems team should be paged and be helping the issue.  If you really need 2am releases, then you need a larger systems team to provide adequate coverage anyway.

Same reason why I don't trust a sysadmin to architect a network; they might know how to create a vlan on a switch, but it doesn't mean they know how to build and run a large network.

Regarding compliance, I'm talking about stipulations along the lines of ""if you wrote it, you are not allowed near it in a production environment.""

You personally might, but you're in the minority.  Systems guys are typically less trusting and take an opposite approach; after all, we have to assume the worst.

SRE has nothing to do with QA.

Don't get me wrong, I am all for dev and sysadmin/SRE/whatever working together, but giving developer access to production seems very sloppy and can be a liability.  

Developers should have their own environments they can do with as they please, but production should be treated as sacred ground.  Get a release engineer for your project; set a daily/weekly/whatever release cycle.  Have dev/testing/staging/qa environments that are actually used.  Don't mess with production.

A developer should not need to be making changes to a production system at 2am, and if that's the case then the systems team should be paged and be helping the issue.  If you really need 2am releases, then you need a larger systems team to provide adequate coverage anyway.

Agreed, but the common approach is to give devs free reign on everything because ""I know what I'm doing.""  Ironically, the loudest complainers about this tend to be the most careless about their actions.

Also, why do you, as a developer *need* production access? The need to monkey patch is not a valid reason.

So, they call it a ""false equivalence"", because they claim that women **need** safe spaces, them being a ""sociological minority"".

Of course, women aren't an actual minority, [in contrary]( ([source]( so they invent ""sociological minority"" (**meaning**: not a minority in numbers, but in influence) to rationalize their discriminating. Ok, the term itself does make some sense, although how much of a ""sociological minority"" women think they are, if at all, remains an opinion. They like us to believe they've got it the worst, of course.

I also won't go into how much they ""need"" it compared to other people (even white men), because they look at everything from a group perspective and wouldn't touch the needs of individuals with a twenty foot pole. Individual problems don't real, no doubt. Discrimination laws exist for the reason that individuals shouldn't be judged based on traits assigned to the groups they belong to. SRS, however, is hellbent on turning that around again and *is* assigning group traits to individuals again. The least privileged of men are still more privileged than the most privileged of women in their logic, because they're men. It's a simple rule, like most bigoted rules are.

**Anyway**, to get to my point: what makes this whole ""theory"" so ridiculous, is that they seem to have the **POWER** to attain women safe-spaces **and** getting rid of men-only clubs.

If they don't have any power or influence, how can safe-spaces even exist? *They can't*. The group in power can simply invade/get rid of those, because they have the power. 

**If this possibility existed, any minority group (think jews in WWII, or human history with religious/racial prosecution, etc) could simply create safe-spaces and avoid prosecution, no matter where or when.** ..but everyone knows they can't.

The only people that can create safe-spaces from other groups in society are those *that have the power*.

So, they call it a ""false equivalence"", because they claim that women **need** safe spaces, them being a ""sociological minority"".

Of course, women aren't an actual minority, [in contrary]( ([source]( so they invent ""sociological minority"" (**meaning**: not a minority in numbers, but in influence) to rationalize their discriminating. Ok, the term itself does make some sense, although how much of a ""sociological minority"" women think they are, if at all, remains an opinion. They like us to believe they've got it the worst, of course.

I also won't go into how much they ""need"" it compared to other people (even white men), because they look at everything from a group perspective and wouldn't touch the needs of individuals with a twenty foot pole.
