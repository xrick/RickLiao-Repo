**Expert Analysis: Multi-Faceted Statistical Framework for Logit-Based Pronunciation Assessment**

This groundbreaking study by Liao and Chen addresses a critical limitation in computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems. While recent work has demonstrated that raw logit outputs outperform softmax probabilities for Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) scoring, existing methods rely predominantly on rudimentary statistics—maximum values, means, or variance—thereby neglecting the rich temporal dynamics and distributional characteristics inherent in logit sequences.

The authors' contribution is methodologically sophisticated: they systematically introduce five categories of higher-order statistical features that capture pronunciation nuances from complementary perspectives. These include moment-generating functions (skewness, kurtosis) for distribution shape, Shannon entropy for model uncertainty quantification, Gaussian Mixture Models for multimodal distribution fitting, autocorrelation coefficients for temporal stability assessment, and extreme value theory (top-k averaging) for robust peak confidence estimation.

The experimental design is particularly rigorous, employing a two-stage validation protocol on the SpeechOcean762 corpus (2,500 and 5,000 samples). The results reveal a compelling data-dependency phenomenon: shape-based features (kurtosis, skewness) dominate in low-data regimes, while discriminability metrics (mean_logit_margin) and robust peak estimators (evt_k3) achieve superior performance (MCC ~0.37) with sufficient data. This finding has profound implications for adaptive feature selection in production CAPT systems operating under varying data constraints.
