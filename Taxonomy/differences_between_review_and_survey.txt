While "review" and "survey" can sometimes be used interchangeably, they often have distinct meanings and applications:

1. Scope:
   - Review: Generally more focused and in-depth, often examining a specific topic, product, or piece of work.
   - Survey: Usually broader in scope, aiming to gather information on a wide range of subjects or from a large group of people.

2. Purpose:
   - Review: Often evaluative, providing critical analysis or assessment.
   - Survey: Primarily for data collection and gathering opinions or information.

3. Format:
   - Review: Typically narrative-based, offering detailed commentary.
   - Survey: Often uses structured questions, like multiple choice or rating scales.

4. Depth:

   - Survey: Generally aims for breadth rather than depth.

5. Audience:
   - Review: Often intended for potential consumers or a specific interested audience.
