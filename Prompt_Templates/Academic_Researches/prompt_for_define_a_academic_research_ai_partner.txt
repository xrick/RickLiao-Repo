I love doing research with the help of LLM Models. It saves me so much time.

And when it comes to ChatGPT, you can get everything as you want.

However, a common challenge is knowing how to craft an effective prompt.

Hey guys this is Kanika, your Passive Income Coach and in today’s article I am going to teach you about how you can research about any topic, with ChaGPT.

I had a simple plan for this article when I started. I wanted to walk you through how to research any topic step-by-step. Let’s say you want to learn about AI — where do you start? What questions should you ask first, and what comes next?

I’ll share a template you can use to get the ball rolling. Then I’ll break it down and explain why each part matters. Also I will try to make more pointers, because I feel pointers are easy to remember.

By the end, you’ll have a good grip on how to dig into any subject, not just how to ask the right questions. It’s about learning to learn, you know?

Ok, so without any further delay let’s get started!

Step 1: Define the Topic and Scope

Defining your topic is like setting the foundation for a building.

It helps you know exactly what you’re going to explore, giving you a clear direction.

Without this step, your research could become scattered, making it harder to draw meaningful conclusions.

When you clearly define your topic and scope, it becomes easier to explain your research to others.

Whether you’re writing a paper, giving a presentation, or discussing your work, people will understand exactly what you’re exploring and why it’s important.

This was an awesome article. I enjoyed every minute of it. I do have one question to the end of your article you indicated using ChatGPT from the beginning the only problem I see with using only ChatGPT is that it doesn’t provide current information. Would we use another AI model for comfort research information?

This could well be a gamechanger to do solid research! What's not clear to me though, when you get to step10, is the idea that you fit all the previous steps into the final prompt, and then have ChatGPT -based on the total feedback from steps 1 to 9…more
