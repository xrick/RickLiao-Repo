Goal: Improve the clarity and specificity of user queries through iteration.

Given:
- q1: user's original question  
- p1: the full prompt containing q1  
- a1: the generated answer  

Now think step by step:
1. Identify what aspects of q1 led to vague or incomplete parts in a1.  
2. Infer what additional context, format, or constraints would help.  
3. Rewrite q1 as q2—a version optimized for precision, depth, and contextual relevance.

Finally, output:
q2: <improved user query>
Explanation: <why this refined query enhances model understanding>
