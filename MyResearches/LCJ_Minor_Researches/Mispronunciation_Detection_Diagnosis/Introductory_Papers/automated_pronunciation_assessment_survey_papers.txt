Certainly, I can provide you with some highly cited papers on automated pronunciation assessment. However, I should note that I don't have access to real-time citation data, and my knowledge cutoff is in 2024, so there may be more recent or more cited papers that I'm not aware of. Additionally, citation counts can vary depending on the database used. 

Here are some influential papers in the field of automated pronunciation assessment:
